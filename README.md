# Toronto Top Real Estate

### This is a very simple series of web pages, that were created by me on a Web Interface Design course. 
### I want to focus on the term project.It is a simple web page for a real estate company, it has three listings, with expanding images, slideshows, and Google Maps integration.
### It was created using HTML and CSS only. There are various effects, like hovering over the nav bar and expanding the text, that were a challenge without using JavaScript.
