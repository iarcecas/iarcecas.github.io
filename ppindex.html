    <h3>Elon Musk</h3>
    <h5>About two years ago I had the pleasure to work with Noah to get me my dream home. I was pretty nervous
      since I knew that Toronto houses come and go very quick. But after just 3 days of meeting the amazing realtor
      that Noah is, he found the perfect home for my kids and me. I was trully amazed at how Noah managed to do this,
      but I guess that it's just because he is that good at his job. &#11088;&#11088;&#11088;&#11088;&#11088;</h5>

    <h3>Jeff Bezos</h3>
    <h5>I love to work, that is why when I decided to move to Toronto, I didn't know if I was going to have time
      to choose my house. I decided to talk to some of my friends and they all told me to talk to Noah. After having
      an online meeting with him, I instantly knew that this guy was going to find my dream home. After a few weeks of
      looking, Noah talked to me about this wonderful new apartement in Downtown Toronto, I went to check it out and
      instantly fell in love, and now that I have lived here for one month, I can't thank Noah enough.

    <h3>Charles Leclerc</h3>
    <h5>My job requires me to go all around the world, every week I'm at a different country, and having a house
      in this situation is hard for me. I randomly met Noah in one of my races, and we talked for hours. He finally
      told me he was a realtor, and he said that he would garantee me that he'd find a home for me. After a few weeks
      of him facetiming houses to me, he went to the one he thought would be the one. So he told me to fly over there
      without even looking at it, and so I did and completely fell in love with the place. I can trully recommend this
      guy to any of my friends. &#11088;&#11088;&#11088;&#11088;&#11088;
