<h3>Protected Areas</h3>

<br><p>Humans over the years have been degrading land because of food production and forestry. Over one third of all land has been affected by it. As a result, 
    biodiversity and essential ecosystem services, for example carbon storage, have been seriously damaged. To solve this, there are protected areas, which offer land
    that is managed effectively. These areas have many benefits, such as granting sustainabe livelihoods, protecting our health, keep cultural resources safe, and many more.
